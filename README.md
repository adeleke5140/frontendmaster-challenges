## Why did I do this?

Here's a background. I wasn't good at css, well I sucked but I was determined to get better. To that end, building projects was the way to go. I looked up tips and tricks on Google and through that, I discovered frontendmentor. The challenges were really challenging(pun intended) but they made for good practice material. They might look basic and unoriginal but it really helped me solidify the concepts I had learned through various online courses.
